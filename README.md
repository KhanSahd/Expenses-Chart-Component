### What I learned
Doing this project I struggled a little bit with the json file and using javascript to create elements. I ended up figuring out how to use the data in the json file to create the graph. I recently have been getting a lot better at javascript and using the toggle class with event listeners. This project took me a couple hours because this was my first time creating a graph using code. I'm really glad I took this project on because it has 100% made me a better developer and in general made me more comfortable with using new methods to get something done.
